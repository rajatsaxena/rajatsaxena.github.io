			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in the Neurobiology and Behavior department at UC Irvine, 
				advised by Dr Bruce L McNaughton. My research focuses on figuring out how short term memories 
				are consolidated into long term memories through hippocampal-cortical interaction. 
				Previously, I worked as Research Assistant at IISc, Bangalore in Dr Sachin Deshmukh's lab 
				where I worked on understanding the neural correlates of spatial navigation and memory and 
				also developed camera systems to track rodents in large spaces.

			<br/>
<p> Intrigued by almost everything related to engineering, mathematics, philosophy, design and psychology. I like to hack around 
	building machine vision and behavior tracking systems. Most of my non-coding time is spent reading, playing football, 
	rock climbing or watching tv shows. </p>
