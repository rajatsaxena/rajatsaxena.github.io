			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I will be joining as PhD student at UC Irvine. Previously, I worked as Research Assistant at CNS in IISc, Bangalore where I 
				focussed on understanding spatial information processing and memory in hippocampal formation. I was also involved in
				developing an animal behavior tracking system in large environments.</p>
			<br/>
<p> Interested in almost everything related to engineering, neuroscience, philosophy, design and psychology. I love to code, 
	read, travel and meet people from different cultural background. I like to hack around on building intelligent and 
	interactive system using combination of machine learning and computer vision. Most of my non-coding time is spent watching
	tv shows, reading, playing football or rock climbing (only on weekends though). </p>
