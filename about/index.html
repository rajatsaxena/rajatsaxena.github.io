			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in the Neurobiology and Behavior department at UC Irvine, 
				advised by Dr Bruce L McNaughton. My research focuses on figuring out how short term memories 
				are consolidated into long term memories through the hippocampal-cortical ensemble interaction.
				I use a combination of techniques including multi-contact probes, 2-photon imaging and machine 
				learning models to understand continual learning and memory consolidation in the brain. 
				Previously, I was a Research Assistant at IISc, Bangalore in Dr Sachin Deshmukh's lab 
				studying the neural correlates of spatial navigation and memory. During that time, I also developed
				camera systems to track rodents in large spaces.

<p> Intrigued by almost everything related to engineering, mathematics, philosophy, design and psychology. I like to hack around 
	building machine vision and behavior tracking systems. Most of my non-coding time is spent reading, playing soccer, 
	rock climbing or watching tv shows. </p>
