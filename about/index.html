			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a third year PhD student in the Neurobiology and Behavior department at UC Irvine, 
				advised by <a href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/mcnaughton" target="_blank"> Dr. Bruce L. McNaughton </a> and 
				<a href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/gandhi" target="_blank"> Dr. Sunil P. Gandhi </a>. My research focuses on studying how 
				short term memories are consolidated into long term memories through the hippocampal-cortical ensemble 
				interaction. I use a combination of techniques including multi-contact probes, 2-photon imaging and machine 
				learning models to understand continual learning and memory consolidation in the brain. <br/><br/>

				Previously, I was a Research Assistant at IISc, Bangalore in 
				<a href="http://www.cns.iisc.ac.in/home/people/sachin-deshmukh/" target="_blank"> Dr. Sachin Deshmukh's lab </a>
				studying the neural correlates of spatial navigation and memory. During that time, I developed
				<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00215.2018" target="_blank"> camera systems to track rodents in large spaces </a>.
				I received my bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Birla Institute of Technology & Science - Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, India in 2015.

<p> When I am not working, I enjoy playing soccer, salsa dancing, rock climbing, and watching tv shows/anime. 
	I love discussions on almost everything related to engineering, mathematics, philosophy, and design.  </p>
