			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a 1st year PhD student in Neurobiology and Behavior department, UC Irvine. I joined Dr Bruce 
				McNaughton's lab for my thesis and am working on understanding the
				interaction between the hippocampus and neocortex. Previously, I worked as Research Assistant at CNS in IISc, 
				Bangalore where my projects were targeted towards understanding spatial information processing in the 
				hippocampal formation. I was also involved in
				developing an animal behavior tracking system in large environments.</p>
			<br/>
<p> Intrigued by almost everything and anything related to engineering, mathematics, philosophy, design and psychology. I like to hack around building intelligent and 
	interactive system using a combination of machine learning and computer vision. Most of my non-coding time is spent watching
	tv shows, reading, playing football or rock climbing. </p>
