			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a fourth year PhD student in the Neurobiology and Behavior department at UC Irvine, 
				advised by <a href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/mcnaughton" target="_blank"> Dr. Bruce L. McNaughton </a>. I'm currently a fourth-year Neuroscience graduate student in the 
				McNaughton lab at the University of California, Irvine. My research focuses on studying how short-term memories are consolidated into long-term memories by looking 
				at the hippocampus-neocortex ensemble interaction. I use a combination of techniques, including high-density silicon probes, 2-photon imaging, and deep learning models, 
				to understand continual learning and memory consolidation in the brain. I also got to spend Summer 2020 
				working remotely on developing single-unit classifier for <a href="https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort" target="_blank"> Kilosort2 </a> 
				spike sorting algoirthm with <a href="https://www.janelia.org/people/marius-pachitariu" target="_blank"> Dr. Marius Pachitariu</a>.

				Previously, I was a Research Assistant at IISc, Bangalore in 
				<a href="http://www.cns.iisc.ac.in/home/people/sachin-deshmukh/" target="_blank"> Dr. Sachin Deshmukh's lab </a>
				studying the neural correlates of spatial navigation and memory. During that time, I developed
				<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00215.2018" target="_blank"> camera systems to track rodents in large spaces </a>.
				I received my bachelor's degree in Information Systems from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, India in 2015.

<p> When I am not working, I enjoy playing soccer, electric guitar, salsa dancing, rock climbing, and watching tv shows/anime. 
	I love discussions on almost everything related to engineering, mathematics, philosophy, and design.  </p>
