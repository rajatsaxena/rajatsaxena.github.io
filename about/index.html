			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently 1st year PhD student in Neurobiology and Behavior, UC Irvine. I joined Dr Bruce McNaughton for my thesis where I am interested in understanding the
				interaction between hippocampus and neocortex. Previously, I worked as Research Assistant at CNS in IISc, Bangalore where I 
				focussed on understanding spatial information processing and memory in hippocampal formation. I was also involved in
				developing an animal behavior tracking system in large environments.</p>
			<br/>
<p> Interested in almost everything related to engineering, mathematics, philosophy, design and psychology. I like to hack around building intelligent and 
	interactive system using a combination of machine learning and computer vision. Most of my non-coding time is spent watching
	tv shows, reading, playing football or rock climbing. </p>
