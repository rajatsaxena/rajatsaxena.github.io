			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Neurobiology and Behavior department at UC Irvine, 
				advised by <a href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/mcnaughton" target="_blank"> Dr. Bruce L McNaughton </a> and 
				<a href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/gandhi" target="_blank"> Dr. Sunil P Gandhi </a>. My research focuses on studying how 
				short term memories are consolidated into long term memories through the hippocampal-cortical ensemble 
				interaction. I use a combination of techniques including multi-contact probes, 2-photon imaging and machine 
				learning models to understand continual learning and memory consolidation in the brain. 
				Previously, I was a Research Assistant at IISc, Bangalore in 
				<a href="http://www.cns.iisc.ac.in/home/people/sachin-deshmukh/" target="_blank"> Dr Sachin Deshmukh's lab </a>
				studying the neural correlates of spatial navigation and memory. During that time, I developed
				camera systems to track rodents in large spaces.

<p> Intrigued by almost everything related to engineering, mathematics, philosophy, design and psychology. I like to hack around 
	building machine vision and behavior tracking systems. Most of my non-coding time is spent reading, playing soccer, 
	rock climbing or watching tv shows. </p>
